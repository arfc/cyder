*Cyder* is being developed in an open environment.  For the current status of *Cyder*, visit http://github.com/katyhuff/cyder.

Software Process & Architecture
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As indicated above, the software architecture and accompanying development
process are critical to a simultaneously robust and flexible analysis platform.

Open Source Development Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Cyder* development framework employs a modern, open source philosophy
that ensures transparency, attracts contributions from a varied community of
collaborators, and guarantees institution-independent access to all potential
users. In this development path, a public source code repository provides
unhindered access to the process algorithms and source code.

Another aspect of this development process is a preference for open source
third party libraries where additional functionality is necessary and available
from such libraries.  This includes basic infrastructure such as file
input/output, as well as model-specific capabilities like integer programming
for network flow optimization.

Dynamic Coupling With Cyclus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cyder is  a dynamically loadable facility module intended for use within Cyclus.
