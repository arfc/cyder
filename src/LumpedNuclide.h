/** 
   @brief LumpedNuclide is a nuclide transport model that treats the volume 
   as a lumped parameter type nuclide transport model. This method is experimental, 
   and was not proposed in my prelim. This model may be influence by a paper by 
   Zuber and Maloszewski, as well as the inverse problem of that discussed in :

   Zuber, A., Maloszewski, P., 2001. Lumped-parameter models. Environmental Isotopes 
   in the Hydrological Cycle. Vol. 6: Modelling, UNESCO, Paris, Tech. Doc. in Hydrology 
   39, 5â€“35. 

   and :

   "Lumped Parameter models as a tool for determining the hydrological parameters of some 
   groundwater systems based on isotope data." Tracers and Modelling in Hydrogeology. 
   (Proceedings of the TraM 2000 Conference in Liege Belgium, May 2000). IAH Publ. no 262, 
   2000.
   
   This disposal system nuclide model will receive material blindly  at both borders.
   Received material will be incorporated and transferred to the opposite boundary according
   to lumped conductivity parameters.

   The parameters may be dependent on current contaiminant concentration.
   
   The LumpedNuclide model can be used to represent nuclide models of the 
   disposal system such as the Waste Form, Waste Package, Buffer, Near Field,
   Far Field, and Envrionment.
