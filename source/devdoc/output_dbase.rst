Output Database
===============


Provenance
++++++++++

Good provenance will be provided by an output database with sufficient data to
allow reproducibility of the results. This robust reproducibility is essential
to the scientific effort. In the case of *Cyder*, the inclusion of a complete
notion of the input specifications in the output database will be sufficient to
allow for result reproduction as well as facilitate knowledge sharing,
post-simulation analysis and error-checking. Such input specifications include
a complete description of the simulation parameters and model configurations
defined in the input.
